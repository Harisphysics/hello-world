From monday to fryday, I spend my time to work with my thesis project in the lab.
I go to the lab at 7.30 a.m. The come back at 7.00 p.m.
I enjoy my day in the lab, because I can explore many thing to improve my skill on understanding about laboratory instrument.
Someday, I want to create a company producing laboratory instrument and help people work more effectively by using my product.
I want to start my company by producing optical instrumentation, because I am quite confidence with my understanding in that field.
